#### Objective:
<p>
    To verify that,
    <strong>"A person’s ability to be random peaks around 25 years old and declines after 60."</strong>

<li>
    The correlation between age and randomness score is close to <strong>zero.</strong>
</li>

<li>
    The straight line in scatter plot shows <strong>little to none change in the trend </strong> over age.

#### Conclusion:
<p> The statement, "A person’s ability to be random peaks around 25 years old and declines after 60." is <strong>not true.</strong> </p>
